def genred(args=None):
    """``genred apfile rfile bias dark flat fmap fpair seeing (sworst
    binfac) template (inst (nccd (ccd) nonlin sat scale readout
    gain))``

    Generates a reduce file as needed by |reduce| or |psf_reduce|. You
    give it the name of an aperture file, calibration frames and a few
    other parameters and it will write out a reduce file which you can
    then refine by hand. The aim is to try to get a reduce file that
    is self-consistent and works to get observing started as soon as
    possible. The parameters are not necessarily the best.

    It is assumed that the target is called '1', the main comparison '2'.

    To avoid endless prompts, genred does not prompt for all
    parameters but accepts a "template" file which can just be from a
    previous run of genred where such parameters can be altered by
    editing with a standard text editor before running genred. genred
    recognises some standard instrument telescope combinations which
    it uses to set parameters such as the pixel scale and readout
    noise, but if you choose other, you will be prompted for these
    details. The main parameters it does prompt for are calibration
    files, and it allows you to define a "seeing" which then controls
    the setting of various profile fit parameters. This can be ignored
    by setting = 0, in which case any template parameters will be passed
    unchanged.

    Parameters:

        apfile : str
           the input aperture file created using |setaper| (default
           extension .ape). This will be read for the targets. The
           main target will be assumed to have been called '1', the
           main comparison '2'. If there is a '3' it will be plotted
           relative to '2'; all others will be ignored for plotting
           purposes. Target '2' will be used to define the position
           and transmission plots for one CCD only [user
           definable]. Target '1' will be used for the seeing plot
           unless it is linked when target '2' will be used instead.

        rfile : str
           the output reduce file created by this script. The main
           target will be assumed to have been called '1', the main
           comparison '2'. If there is a '3' it will be plotted
           relative to '2'; all others will be ignored for plotting
           purposes.

        bias : str
           Name of bias frame; 'none' to ignore.

        dark : str
           Name of dark frame; 'none' to ignore.

        flat : str
           Name of flat field frame; 'none' to ignore.

        fmap : str
           Name of fringe frame; 'none' to ignore.

        fpair : str [if fmap not 'none']
           File defining pairs to measure fringe amplitudes.

        seeing : float
           estimate of seeing which will be used to define several of
           the profile fitting parameters. Enter 0 to ignore and use
           defaults from the template (or genred if no template)
           instead.

        sworst : float [if seeing > 0]
           worst seeing expected during run. Expands the search and
           fitting boxes which can cause difficulties if they are
           too small. It also sets the maximum target aperture radius
           which will set to ~ 1.8*sworst, converted to pixels, and the
           sky annulus radii. It has to be at least 2*seeing. Always
           remember that you can override the automated settings using
           a pre-edited template and seeing = 0.

        binfac : int [if seeing > 0]
           binning factor. e.g. 4 if using 4x4. Needed to optimise some
           profile parameters.

        template : str
           Reduce file to use as a template for any parameters not set
           by genred. This allows one to tweak settings by running
           genred without a template, then modifying the resultant
           file and using it as a template. 'none' to ignore, and then
           these values will be set by genred by default. Some will be
           modified anyway (e.g. the calibration file names), and if
           seeing > 0, then several of the profile fitting paramaters
           will be adapted to the value given along with the
           instrument parameters.  genred will try to keep as many of
           the 'extraction', 'position', 'transmission', 'light' etc
           lines associated with particular CCDs in this case without
           modification, and will pass readout, saturation levels etc
           unchanged from the template.

        inst : str [if template == 'none']
           the instrument. 'hipercam-gtc', 'ultracam-ntt', 'ultraspec-tnt',
           'ultracam-wht', 'ultracam-vlt',  or 'other'. Sets pixel scale and
           standard readnoise params.

        nccd : int [if inst == 'other']
           number of CCDs.

        ccd : int [if nccd > 1]
           the CCD to use for position plots

        nonlin : list(float) [if inst == 'other']
           values for warning of non linearity

        sat : list(float) [if inst == 'other']
           values for warning of saturation

        scale : float [if inst == 'other']
           image scale in arcsec/pixel

        readout : float | string [if inst == 'other']
           readout noise, RMS ADU. Can either be a single value or an
           hcm file.

        gain : float | string [if inst == 'other']
           gain, electrons per ADU. Can either be a single value or an
           hcm file.

# The next section '[apertures]' defines how the apertures are
# re-positioned from frame to frame. Apertures are re-positioned
# through a combination of a search near a start location followed by
# a 2D profile fit. Several parameters below are associated with this
# process and setting these right can be the key to a successful
# reduction.  If there are reference apertures, they are located first
# to give a mean shift. This is used to avoid the initial search for
# any non-reference apertures which has the advantage of reducing the
# chance of problems. The search is carried out by first extracting a
# sub-window centred on the last good position of a target. This is
# then smoothed by a gaussian (width 'search_smooth_fwhm'), and the
# closest peak to the last valid position higher than
# 'fit_height_min_ref' above background (median of the square box) is
# taken as the initial position for later profile fits. The smoothing
# serves to make the process more robust against cosmic rays. The
# width of the search box ('search_half_width') depends on how good
# the telescope guiding is. It should be large enough to cope with the
# largest likely shift in position between any two consecutive
# frames. Well-chosen reference targets, which should be isolated and
# bright, can help this process a great deal. The threshold is applied
# to the *smoothed* image. This means that it can be significantly
# lower than simply the raw peak height. e.g. a target might have a
# typical peak height around 100, in seeing of 4 pixels FWHM. If you
# smooth by 10 pixels, the peak height will drop to
# 100*4**2/(4**2+10**2) = 14 counts. It will be much more stable as a
# result, but you should then probably choose a threshold of 7 when
# you might have thought 50 was appropriate. The smoothing itself can
# be carried out by direct convolution or by an FFT-based method. The
# end-result is the same either way but for large values of
# 'search_smooth_fwhm', i.e. >> 1, FFTs may offer an advantage
# speed-wise. But the only way to tell is by explicity running with
# 'search_smooth_fft' switched from 'no' to 'yes'.

# The boxes for the fits ('fit_half_width') need to be large enough to
# include the target and a bit of sky to ensure that the FWHM is
# accurately measured, remembering that seeing can flare of course. If
# your target was defocussed, a gaussian or Moffat function will be a
# poor fit and you may be better keeping the FWHM fixed at a large
# value comparable to the widths of your defoccused images (and use
# the gaussian option in such cases). If the apertures are chosen to
# be fixed, there will be no search or fit carried out in which case
# you must choose 'fixed' as well when it comes the extraction since
# otherwise it needs a FWHM. 'fixed' is a last resort and you will
# very likely need to use large aperture radii in the extraction
# section.

# An obscure parameter is 'fit_ndiv'. If this is made > 0, the fit
# routine attempts to allow for pixellation by evaluating the profile
# at multiple points within each pixel of the fit. First it will
# evaluate the profile for every unbinned pixel within a binned pixel
# if the pixels are binned; second, it will evaluate the profile over
# an ndiv by ndiv square grid within each unbinned pixel. Thus ndiv=1
# means one evaluation at the centre of each unbinned pixel,
# etc. Obviously this will slow things, but it could help if your
# images are under-sampled. I would always start with fit_ndiv=0, and
# only raise it if the measured FWHM seem to be close to or below two
# binned pixels.

# If you use reference targets (you should if possible), the initial
# positions for the non-reference targets should be good. You can then
# guard further against problems using the parameter 'fit_max_shift'
# to reject positions for the non-reference targets that shift too far
# from the initial guess. 'fit_alpha' is another parameter that
# applies only in this case. If reference apertures are being used,
# the expected locations of non-reference apertures can be predicted
# with some confidence. In this case when the non-reference aperture's
# position is measured, its position will be adjusted by 'fit_alpha'
# times the measured change in its position. Its value is bounded by 0
# < fit_alpha <= 1. "1" just means use the full measured change from
# the current frame to update the position. Anything < 1 builds in a
# bit of past history. The hope is that this could make the aperture
# positioning, especially for faint targets, more robust to cosmic
# rays and other issues.  Of course it will correlate the positions
# from frame to frame. fit_alpha = 0.1 for instance will lead to a
# correlation length ~ 10 frames.

# If you use > 1 reference targets, then the parameter 'fit_diff'
# comes into play.  Multiple reference targets should move together
# and give very consistent shifts. If they don't, then a problem may
# have occurred, e.g. one or more have been affected by a meteor trail
# for instance. The maximum acceptable differential shift is defined
# by 'fit_diff'. If exceeded, then the entire extraction will be
# aborted and positions held fixed.

# To get and idea of the right values of some of these parameters, in
# particular the 'search_half_width', the height thresholds,
# 'fit_max_shift' and 'fit_diff', the easiest approach is probably to
# run a reduction with loose values and see how it goes.

# The next lines define how the apertures will be re-sized and how the
# flux will be extracted from the aperture. There is one line per CCD
# with format:

# <CCD label> = <resize> <extract method> [scale min max] [scale min max]
#               [scale min max]

# where: <CCD label> is the CCD label; <resize> is either 'variable'
# or 'fixed' and sets how the aperture size will be determined -- if
# variable it will be scaled relative to the FWHM, so profile fitting
# will be attempted; <extract method> is either 'normal' or 'optimal'
# to say how the flux will be extracted -- 'normal' means a straight
# sum of sky subtracted flux over the aperture, 'optimal' use Tim
# Naylor's profile weighting, and requires profile fits to
# work. Finally there follow a series of numbers in three triplets,
# each of which is a scale factor relative to the FWHM for the
# aperture radius if the 'variable' option was chosen, then a minimum
# and a maximum aperture radius in unbinned pixels.  The three triples
# correspond to the target aperture radius, the inner sky radius and
# finally the outer sky radius. The mininum and maximum also apply if
# you choose 'fixed' apertures and can be used to override whatever
# value comes from the aperture file. A common approach is set them
# equal to each other to give a fixed value, especially for the sky
# where one does not necessarily want the radii to vary.  For PSF
# photometry, all these settings have no effect, but this section can
# still be used to determine which CCDs have fluxes extracted.

# The next lines are specific to the PSF photometry option. 'gfac' is
# used to label the sources according to groups, such that stars
# closer than 'gfac' times the FWHM are labelled in the same
# group. Each group has a PSF model fit independently. The reason
# behind the construction of groups is to reduce the dimensionality of
# the fitting procedure. Usually you want closely seperated stars to
# be fit simultaneously, but too large a value will mean fitting a
# model with many free parameters, which can fail to converge. The
# size of the box over which data is collected for fitting is set by
# 'fit_half_width'. Finally, 'positions' determines whether the star's
# positions should be considered variable in the PSF fitting. If this
# is set to fixed, the positions are held at the locations found in
# the aperture repositioning step, otherwise the positions are refined
# during PSF fitting. This step can fail for PSF photometry of faint
# sources.

# Next lines determine how the sky background level is

# If you specify "!" for the readout, an attempt to estimate it from
# +/- 1 sigma percentiles will be made. This could help if you have no
# bias (and hence variance calculation from the count level will be
# wrong)

# The fringe parameters are the most complex. To de-fringe you need
# first a fringe map, e.g. as returned by makefringe. Then you need a
# file of FringePairs as returned by 'setfringe'. These are pairs of
# points placed at peaks and troughs of fringes. They will be used to
# measure a series of differences in each frame of interest and the
# fringe map from which a series of ratios is formed. The differences
# are measured from a group of pixels extending +/-nhlaf around the
# central pixel of each point of a FringePair. Thus nhalf=2 would give
# a 5x5 array (unbinned pixels). Finally to reduce the effect of bad
# values the individual ratios can be pruned if they lie outside a
# range rmin to rmax prior to their overall median being calculated.
# rmin should be small, but probably slightly less than zero to allow
# for a bit of statistical fluctuation, depending on your setup. One
# would normally expect rmax < 1 if the fringe map came from frames with
