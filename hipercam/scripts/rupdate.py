# rupdate -- updates an old reduce file
#
################################################


def rupdate(args=None):
    """``rupdate rfile``

    As changes are made to 'reduce', old reduce files can become
    obsolete. This script tries to bring old reduce files up to date
    by adding in the new options but in a way that should give the old
    behaviour. The file is modified in place.

    There are some cases where a full update might not be possible and
    a further manual edit of the reduce file might be required.

    Parameters:

        rfile    : string
           the output reduce file created using |setaper|. This will be read
           for the targets. The main target will be assumed to have been
           called '1', the main comparison '2'. If there is a '3' it will be
           plotted relative to '2'; all others will be ignored for plotting
           purposes.
