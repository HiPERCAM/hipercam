Section for handling the raw HiPERCAM data files. These are FITS files
with a single HDU containing header information on the window format amonst
other things with the data in a "FITS cube" of unusual nature in that it has
dimensions of nframe x 1 x lots, where "lots" contains all pixels of all
windows of all CCDs plus timing bytes at the end. The pixels come in an odd
order (pixel 1 of each window and then the same for each CCD etc), and the
main work of the code is in disentangling them to produce :class:MCCD objects.

    The following attributes are set::

       cheads : list of Header objects
           the headers for each CCD which contain any info needed per CCD, above
           all the 'skip' numbers, which are used when creating MCCD frames.

       clear, dummy, oscan, prescan  : bool
           flags to say whether or not the following were enabled:
               clears between exposures
               dummy output
               overscan (extra pixels in Y)
               prescan (extra pixels in X)

       fname : string
           the file name

       header : astropy.io.fits.Header
           the header of the FITS file.

       mode : string
           the readout mode used, read from 'ESO DET READ CURNAME'

       nskips : tuple
           the NSKIP parameters for each CCD (5 of them)

       ntbytes : int
           number of timing bytes, deduced from the dimensions of the FITS cube
           (NAXIS1 contains all pixels and timing bytes) compared to the window
           dimensions.

       nwins : tuple
           integer indices of the windows for any one quadrant. This is (0,) for
           one window modes, (0,1) for two window modes.

       tdead, tdelta, toff1, toff2, toff3, toff4 : float
           set of parameters used to calculate exact times. tdead is the
           dead time between exposures; tdelta is used to multiply NSKIP
           for each CCD; toff1 etc are offsets and lengths used to get the
           mid-exposure times and exposure durations.

       thead : Header
           the top-level header that will be used to create MCCDs.

       windows : list of list of list of (Winhead, flip) tuples
           windows[nccd][nquad][nwin] returns the Winhead and set of axes for
           window nwin of quadrant nquad of CCD nccd. nwin indexes the windows
           of a given quadrant (at most there are 2, so nwin = 0 or 1). nquad
           indexes the quadrants in EFGH order. nccd index the 5 CCDs. 'flip'
           is a tuple of axes to be flipped using numpy.flip to account for
           where the CCD is read and reflections. These are not in the end the
           final windows that will end in the MCCD because if there are pre-scan
           or over-scan present, we need to split them off making more windows.

       wforms : tuple of strings
           formats of each set of windows as strings designed to match the input
           expected for hdriver.

       xbin : int
           X-binning factor
