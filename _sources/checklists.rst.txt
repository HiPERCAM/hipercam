Observing checklists
********************

The |hiper| pipeline is associated with the high-speed camera |hiper| above
all, but is also designed to be backwards-compatible with the forerunner
instruments ULTRACAM and ULTRASPEC. There are a large number of items to be
aware of for all three instruments. This page contains links to check lists
with the aim of making people aware and reminding people of what to think
about and do during observing.
