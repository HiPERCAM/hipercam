The |hiper| pipeline manual
****************************

The |hiper| reduction software, known as the "pipeline" for short,
serves two purposes. First, it provides a means of displaying and reducing 
|hiper|, ULTRACAM and ULTRASPEC data. Second,
it provides an "Application Programmers Interface" (API) to allow you
to access and manipulate the same sets of data. The first will be of
interest to anyone using |hiper|, ULTRACAM and ULTRASPEC; the second
to those who want to code their own scripts.  This manual covers both
aspects. It does not cover use of the |hiper| GUI or the finding chart
generator, hfinder, or the equivalent components for ULTRACAM and
ULTRASPEC. Details of these for |hiper| may be found on `github
<https://github.com/HiPERCAM>`_; and follows these links for much
more information on 
`ULTRACAM <http://www.vikdhillon.staff.shef.ac.uk/ultracam/userman/userman.html>`_ and
`ULTRASPEC on the TNT <http://www.vikdhillon.staff.shef.ac.uk/ultraspec/ultraspec_tnt.html>`_.
