The API
*******

A large part of the motivation behind the choice of Python for the HiPERCAM
pipeline was to make it straightforward for observers to write their own
add-ons and scripts. Real data invariably throws up exceptions to the rule
which might require a hand-crafted approach. The pipeline API (Application
Programmers Interface) is designed to allow you to do so.
