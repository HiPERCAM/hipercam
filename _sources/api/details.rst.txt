Modules
*******

|hiper|'s classes and methods are spread over a number of sub-modules
which group together related components. This pages gives a link to
documentation auto-generated from the in-code documentation. The same
information can be accessed from a terminal using ``pydoc``. A
recurring feature are individual items that can be grouped into a
bunch representing a CCD's-worth of them and then into a
multiple-CCD's worth. Thus you will see this for windows, defects,
apertures, fringe ampltude pairs etc.

.. Note::

   There is much more to be added here. TBD.
