Observer's guide
================

The |hiper| pipeline allows observers to look at their data as it comes in
and to reduce it in near "real time". It is downstream of the data acquisition
system and has no direct effect upon it. At the telescope its most important
role is to allow you to assess the data as it comes in.

The first two sections of the guide are aimed first at getting
observers started quickly while at the telescope, and second giving a
more in depth description for a later careful
reduction. Implementation details are described in the section on the
underlying principles, which contains further tips on good practice.
